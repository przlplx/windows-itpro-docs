# System SKU reference

This document provides a reference of System Model and System SKU names that you can use to quickly determine the machine state of a specific device by using PowerShell or WMI.

System Model and System SKU are variables that are stored in System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) tables in the UEFI layer of Surface devices. The System SKU name is required to differentiate between devices that have the same System Model name, such as Surface Pro and Surface Pro with LTE Advanced. 

| Device   | System Model | System SKU       |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Surface 3 WiFI                                               | Surface 3        | Surface_3                        |
| Surface 3 LTE AT&T                                           | Surface 3        | Surface_3_US1                    |
| Surface 3 LTE Verizon                                        | Surface 3        | Surface_3_US2                    |
| Surface 3 LTE North America                                  | Surface 3        | Surface_3_NAG                    |
| Surface 3 LTE Outside of North America and Y!mobile In Japan | Surface 3        | Surface_3_ROW                    |
| Surface Pro                                                  | Surface Pro      | Surface_Pro_1796                 |
| Surface Pro with LTE Advanced                                | Surface Pro      | Surface_Pro_1807                 |
| Surface Book 2 13inch                                        | Surface Book 2   | Surface_Book_1832                |
| Surface Book 2 15inch                                        | Surface Book 2   | Surface_Book_1793                |
| Surface Go Consumer                                          | Surface Go       | Surface_Go_1824_Consumer         |
| Surface Go Commercial                                        | Surface Go       | Surface_Go_1824_Commercial       |
| Surface Pro 6 Consumer                                       | Surface Pro 6    | Surface_Pro_6_1796_Consumer      |
| Surface Pro 6 Commercial                                     | Surface Pro 6    | Surface_Pro_6_1796_Commercial    |
| Surface Laptop 2 Consumer                                    | Surface Laptop 2 | Surface_Laptop_2_1769_Consumer   |
| Surface Laptop 2 Commercial                                  | Surface Laptop 2 | Surface_Laptop_2_1769_Commercial |

## Examples 

**PowerShell**

Run the following PowerShell command to pull System SKU:

 ``` 
gwmi -namespace root\wmi -class MS_SystemInformation | select SystemSKU 
```

**System Information**

You can also find the System SKU and System Model for a device in System Information. 

- Go to **Start** > **MSInfo32**.  

One example of how you could use this in the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or System Center Configuration Manager is as part of a Task Sequence WMI Condition. For example: 

**Task Sequence WMI Condition**

    - WMI Namespace – Root\WMI
    - WQL Query – SELECT * FROM MS_SystemInformation WHERE SystemSKU = "Surface_Pro_1796"
